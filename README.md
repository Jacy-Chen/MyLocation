# MyLocation
This is my practice project according to the tutorial from www.raywenderlich.com

## Brief Intro
This app uses the Core Location framework to obtain GPS coordiates for the user's whereabouts, Map Kit to show the user's favorite locations on a map, the iPhone's camera and photo library to attach photos to the locations, and finally, Core Data to store everything in a database.

## Key Features
* Core Location 
* Reverse geocoding
* Disable size class --> Using auto sizing instead of auto layout for simple layout app
